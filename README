Notes:
- Type 'make' to build the application. Type 'make clean' to remove the executable and
  object files.
- The swarm_config_file should contain a separate line for each server to download from.
  The format of each line should be as such: ftp://username:password@servername/file-path
- Each line of the swarm_config_file needs to be separated by a Line Feed (LF)
  character. Carriage Return (CR) characters will not work.
- Valid values for <mode> are: ASCII, binary (case-sensitive)
- If '-' (without quotes) is specified for <logfile>, then all commands will be printed
  to the standard output.
- When invoked without any options, the application will display help and usage
  information and exit with status 0.
- If an option is specified multiple times, the last argument assigned to that option is
  the argument accepted.
- When using a swarm_config_file, any arguments specified for username and password
  through options will be overridden by the values specified in the file.
